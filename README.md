## 🛠 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Modern web browser with WebGL support

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeantimex/flight-path.git
   cd flight-path
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Build for Production

```bash
# Build optimized production bundle
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Basic Navigation

- **Mouse drag**: Rotate camera around Earth
- **Mouse wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **GUI panels**: Adjust visualization parameters in real-time

### Performance Tips

- Start with fewer flights (1000-5000) and increase gradually
- Use "Hide Path" or "Hide Plane" to focus on specific elements
- Enable performance monitoring with 'P' key (development mode)

### Customization

- Modify flight data in `src/Data.js` for custom routes
- Add new aircraft designs by placing SVG files in `public/` directory
- Adjust shader parameters in `src/shaders/` for visual effects

## 🏗 Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **Three.js**: 3D graphics and WebGL rendering
